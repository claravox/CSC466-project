# CSC466-project

As Cal Poly students approach graduation, one of the questions at the forefront of our minds are where we may end up after we walk across the stage. 

By assessing graduate salary data as well as city based livable wage data in conjunction with housing prices, this project attempts to answer common questions a graduating student may ask.
